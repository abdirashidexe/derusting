# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

1. Wrote double instead of float first
2. ArrayList<> should be arraylist(String)
3. Looked up java methods to find set()
4. Looked up java collections sort
5. changed ArrayList .. = New ArrayList<String>(); to List .. = New ArrayList<String>();
6. added <String> to List .. = New ArrayList<String>(); so it's now List<String> .. = New ArrayList<String>(); (had to look up)
7. had to change /n to \n
8. had to look up to how set a size for an array
9. had to look up why toString() wasnt working for myArray.toString(). turns out its Arrays.toString(myArray);
10. had to look up and make sure i was right in using .contains() to find substring and not another method i didn't think of
11. had to look up method that joins strings without using a loop and .concat

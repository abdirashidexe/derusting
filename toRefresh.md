# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

1. Wrote double instead of float first
2. ArrayList<> should be arraylist(String)
3. Looked up java methods to find set()
